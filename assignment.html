		<h2>Experience of web development</h2>
<p>-My experience for the first semester of web development was very educative and insightful. Starting from learning the basics of github to making my very first website, I have developed a lot of confidence on web development.</p>
 <h2>Discussion of the module</h2>
<p>-The module for web development started by teaching us about github as to how to make github account, github commands, push-pull on github and vice versa. We started learning about html. first starting out by installing code editor and learning about basic html, html tags, attributes. Then, making a simple website. To design the website we learnt about CSS. Throughout the first term of the module we learnt about ways to design CSS efficiently, more insight on CSS properties and designing the website using various CSS properties. As time passed I learned more ideas on how to make a proper website. The correct ways to use tags and attributes, the do's and do not's, what kind of design to use on a particular page. I also had a hard time because of errors. Simply missing a semi-colon or forgetting brackets, closing brackets, close tags made my code irrelevant. But overtime I learnt not to make these mistakes and also to check the code more meticulously.<br>
I can say that I enjoyed learning the whole course and have understood the way to make a website using html and CSS in depth.</p><br>
<h2> Assignment</h2>
<p>-When I received the mail for the assignment, I thought a lot about the ways to make to website. What kind of design should I use? How can I make it look efficient? I decided to make the website simple to not to make it too overwhelming. I do not have a lot of designs on my website. I mostly only designed my website with the background and font. For the background, throughout the website I used a gradient with mix of my favorite colors and decided to put simple fonts.  There are four main pages on the website, home, contact page, portfolio page and curriculum vitae.</p>
<h3>For homepage</h3>
<p> -I added a simple text with my name on it and there is a menu page at the corner right. Making a responsive hamburger was very tricky but learning about it in depth helped me build it.</p>
<h3> For the portfolio page (My Work) </h3>
<p>
-This page contained placeholder images. I used 8 images and put them in a grid. This will be replaced by later work.</p>
<h3>For the Contact Page</h3>
<p>-The left side of the contact page had contact information and the center contained a simple form where you can input last name, first name, email and a message. There is a button which sends the information. </p>
<h3> 
For the curriculum vitae page</h3>
<p>
-The resume page is divided into 2 columns which has some of my information and work. I did not use much designs in the page, just fonts, colors and the grid. <p>
	<br>
	<p>
This is how I created and designed my website. I wanted my website to be simple yet an enticing website. The process included a lot of errors, design doubts, debugging and also a lot of practical learning. Making the website helped me grow my knowledge on html, CSS and making of a website. This certainly was a very informative and engaging project. </p>
